# DynamoToElasticSearchGeospatialDataFeeder

This is a sample template for DynamoToElasticSearchGeospatialDataFeeder - Below is a brief explanation of what we have generated for you:

```bash

```

## Requirements

* AWS CLI already configured with Administrator permission
* [Docker installed](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)
* [Golang](https://golang.org)

## Setup process

### Installing dependencies

dependencies are managed using go modules

### Building

Golang is a staticly compiled language, meaning that in order to run it you have to build the executeable target.

You can issue the following command in a shell to build it:


```shell
make build
```

**NOTE**: If you're not building the function on a Linux machine, you will need to specify the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables, this allows Golang to build your function for another system architecture and ensure compatability.

## Packaging and deployment
run the following command to package our Lambda function to S3:

```bash
sam package \
    --output-template-file packaged.yaml \
    --s3-bucket dynamodb-to-es-cook-location-data-feeder-lambda
```

Next, the following command will create a Cloudformation Stack and deploy your SAM resources.

```bash
sam deploy \
    --template-file packaged.yaml \
    --stack-name DynamoToESCookLocationDataFeeder \
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

> **See [Serverless Application Model (SAM) HOWTO Guide](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/HOWTO.md) for more details in how to get started.**

After deployment is complete you can run the following command to retrieve the API Gateway Endpoint URL:

```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
    --stack-name DynamoToESCookLocationDataFeeder \
    --query 'Stacks[].Outputs'
``` 

### Testing

We use `testing` package that is built-in in Golang and you can simply run the following command to run our tests:

```shell
go test -v ./data-feeder/
```
# Appendix

### Golang installation

Please ensure Go 1.x (where 'x' is the latest version) is installed as per the instructions on the official golang website: https://golang.org/doc/install

A quickstart way would be to use Homebrew, chocolatey or your linux package manager.

#### Homebrew (Mac)

Issue the following command from the terminal:

```shell
brew install golang
```

If it's already installed, run the following command to ensure it's the latest version:

```shell
brew update
brew upgrade golang
```

#### Chocolatey (Windows)

Issue the following command from the powershell:

```shell
choco install golang
```

If it's already installed, run the following command to ensure it's the latest version:

```shell
choco upgrade golang
```
## AWS CLI commands

AWS CLI commands to package, deploy and describe outputs defined within the cloudformation stack:

```bash
sam package \
    --template-file template.yaml \
    --output-template-file packaged.yaml \
    --s3-bucket dynamodb-to-es-cook-location-data-feeder-lambda

sam deploy \
    --template-file packaged.yaml \
    --stack-name DynamoToESCookLocationDataFeeder \
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM \

aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
    --stack-name DynamoToESCookLocationDataFeeder --query 'Stacks[].Outputs'
```

## Bringing to the next level

Here are a few ideas that you can use to get more acquainted as to how this overall process works:

* Create an additional API resource (e.g. /hello/{proxy+}) and return the name requested through this new path
* Update unit test to capture that
* Package & Deploy

Next, you can use the following resources to know more about beyond hello world samples and how others structure their Serverless applications:

* [AWS Serverless Application Repository](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo/)
